				<h2>Comparison Project 1</h2>

				<p>This website uses a vertical layout. The webpage uses a light background to highlight the main part, which is the image. When the viewer's mouse moves over a different image, the color of the image will become darker and the image in the lower layer will be displayed to the top of the page. In addition, the designers of the website used images of different sizes in the layout to increase the asymmetric beauty and interest of the page. Overall, I think this website is very concise but interesting. This website can also add some overlays to achieve more interactive ways to make the content of the web page richer.</p>

				<h2>Comparison Project 2</h2>

				<p>This website also uses a vertical layout. Unlike the previous website, this website is very rich in content, which also contains a lot of interactive elements. First of all, at the top of this website is a collection of a series of elements. When the viewer's mouse moves over an element that can be interacted with, there will be animations to prompt the viewer to click. When the viewer clicks on an element that can be interacted with, the page will drop down to the corresponding position. At the same time, when the viewer clicks the back button in the lower right corner, the page will return to the top. The color contrast of the website is also very good. Although the designer uses a lot of colors, the alternation and balance of warm and cold tones make the overall page very aesthetic.</p>

				<h2>Project Goals</h2>

				<p>I think my design should be a combination of the above two web designs. What I want to design is a webpage showing my own photography works. The difference between my design and the first web page is that I will add more interactive elements to my design. At the same time, compared to the second website, my design will be more concise. But in terms of layout, I will choose a similar way to the second website. At the top of the website is a collection of a series of different image elements like a picture wall so that the audience can understand the overall content of the web page.

				<h2>Design Strategies</h2>

				<p>In the color matching, I will use light or cool colors as the background. Of course, the picture wall at the top of the page will be distinguished by different colors. The overall webpage will give the audience a sense of fashion or coolness. In the choice of fonts, I will also use some three-dimensional and sharp types to enhance the visual impact of the web page.</p>

				<h2>Interaction Strategies</h2>

				<p>The web page will use portrait layout. At the top of the web page is a collection of a series of different image elements. When the viewer pulls down the page, they will see the details of the image or the enlarged screen. When the viewer clicks on the image at the top of the page, the page will drop down to the corresponding position. I may also use some overlay techniques, when the viewer clicks on the picture, there will be text messages as an explanation.

				<h2>Experience Goals</h2>

				<p>The target audience of my page is photography or image lovers. When designing the layout of the webpage, I will highlight the main part. I hope viewers will focus more on the images when they browse my page.</p>
