            <p>Modal window is a very common element in today's UI design. A modal window is an element that sits on top of an application's main window. After opening the modal window, the user needs to interact with it before returning to the parent application. The use of Modal window can grab the user's attention, get information from the user, show additional information in context or show information that is not directly related to the parent page.</p>
            <p>We also need to consider the following points when using Modal window. First of all, the designer needs to provide an escape hatch for the user, that is, give users a way to close the modal. The second is to set up a descriptive title for the modal window. The third is to add button labels that are operable and easy to understand.</p>
            <p>The fourth is to pay attention to the size and position of the modal window; the modal window should not be too large or too small. The fifth point is to use the lightbox effect when opening the modal window. Darkening the background can attract the user's attention so that they can focus on the modal window. Finally, donâ€™t surprise users by popping up a modal, allowing users to interact autonomously and consciously.</p>
            <p>The use of modal window can sometimes cause confusion to users, so the timing of deciding to use the modal window element is also very important.</p>
