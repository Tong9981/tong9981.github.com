            <p>In many cases, in a website or application, images can convey a lot of feelings that cannot be carried by text. How to observe, select and apply images to our own projects is very important for a designer. First of all, we must learn to observe the pictures and observe carefully. Observation of the details of the picture will bring more understanding of the picture to the audience.</p>
            <p>Secondly, when observing the picture, ask some open-ended questions, such as Whatâ€™s going on in this picture? What do you see that makes you say that? We can also find more details in the process of describing the picture. It is also very important to listen to other people's observations and feelings of pictures, which usually helps us discover some places that may be overlooked by ourselves.</p>
            <p>In addition, expand knowledge of the world also helps our understanding of pictures. Finally, improving visual thinking ability allows us to better use image information in our projects.</p>
