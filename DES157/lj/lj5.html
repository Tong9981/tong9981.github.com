            <h3>Learning Journal: Game Design UX Best Practices</h3>
            <time>2/21/2021 11:45</time>
            <p>In this article, the author believes that the first thing we should consider when designing a game interface is the position of the user interface. Considering the behavior habits of most users, we should set the corresponding comfort-to-reach area and hard-to-reach area. We should do more interaction design in the user's comfort-to-reach area. Secondly, using the slider module can help us expand the screen to provide users with more additional options.</p>
            <p>The pop-up window is also a very good component in the game. The designer can convey more abstract or textual content to the audience through the pop-up component. The author also believes that, for example, in the pop-up window, User decisions that are good for our game are placed on the right side of the popup. Because game designers should expect users to take options that are beneficial to the designer. In addition, in the article, the author also explained the game's advertising rewards, draggable items, and introduction videos. In general, I think the message that the author of this article wants to convey is to hope that game designers will bring users a good user experience while attracting users to take more actions that are beneficial to game profit.</p>
