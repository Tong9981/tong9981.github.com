                <img src="images/4.jpg" alt="Lake" style="width:100%">
                <figcaption>Fig.1 - Lake Tahoe, Tong Su, CA.</figcaption>
              </figure>
            <p>This image was taken in Lake Tahoe on a winter morning. In the distance are the mountains surrounding Lake Tahoe, and in the vicinity is a pier extending towards the lake. Although the picture was taken in winter, the golden yellow reflected by the sun on the snow shows a warm atmosphere. So the color contrast in this picture is very strong.</p>
            <p>The subject of my project is my travel footprint. This picture is the first picture from left to right on my homepage. On my page, I not only want to show the displacement of each picture, but I also want to show the changes in the time of the day for different pictures. So I chose the first picture taken in the morning.</p>

                <img src="images/5.png" alt="Portraits" style="width:100%">
                <figcaption>Fig.2 - Portraits, Cory Risch-Smith, US.</figcaption>
              </figure>
            <p>This picture presents a collection of a series of portraits. It can be seen that the people in the image have different genders and most of them have smiles on their faces. The characters in the picture are all young or middle-aged people without old people and children. And I found that these characters should all be African American. The most interesting thing about this picture is that it is a collection of portraits of people. The viewer can easily find that although the characters in the image are all African American, they have different identities. Therefore, this picture shows unity in the theme but also diversity. I think designers can extend many different themes through this picture, and the rich content contained in this picture can also bring more visual information to the audience.</p>
